--------------------------
Requirements: python 2.5
Tested on: Ubuntu Linux (Feisty), but should work anywhere that Paste
works. 
--------------------------

To install, check out code: 

  % svn co http://microapps.googlecode.com/svn/drinkme/trunk/ drinkme

initialize a workingenv: 

  % cd drinkme
  % ./init.sh .

init.sh takes the directory to put the workingenv in as its only
argument. It will create a workingenv and install all the necessary
(and included) eggs into it. 

edit development.ini, prod.ini, or copy one of those to a different
file and configure to your liking (change port #, etc.)

run it: 

  % ./start.sh . prod.ini

Drinkme is also a WSGI/Paste app, so you should be able to combine it
with any other WSGI frameworks, servers, etc. in a standard manner.
